# Freenove-Smart-Car-for-Raspberry-Pi
The programs listed in this repository was created as part of an exam in Robotics, at University of South-Eastern Norway (USN).


I would first like to mention that before creating the programs in this repository I had no experience with programing. We had roughly 3 months to finish the project. The programs was later implemented in a Freenove Three-wheeled smart car through a Raspberry Pi. The RPI used Linux ubuntu and was able to communicate with the cars hardware through ROS API (Robot Operating System).

Because of my lack of experience with programing there is sertenly a lot of improvements to be made to the code, but as of today it's highly unlikely that I will be able to make that happen.

Feel free to use the code as a referance for similar projects.
